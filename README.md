# GADAPC-GADAC: Predicting Employee Turnover with Logistic Regression and KNN Models in Salifort Motors

see [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/pjpangilinan/GADAPC-GADAC/blob/main/GADAC-C7.ipynb)

## Plan Phase

### Who are your stakeholders for this project?
* Salifort Motorsâ€™ HR department, 
* Senior leadership and management teams, 
* Current employees 
### What are you trying to solve or accomplish? 
* Predict which employees are likely to leave
* Identify key factors influencing employee turnover 
* Provide actionable insights to improve employee retention and satisfaction
### What are your initial observations when you explore the data? 
* There are numerical variables (e.g., satisfaction_level, average_monthly_hours) and categorical variables (e.g., Department, salary) 
* Variables like promotion, work accident, and department might have significant influence on turnover
### What resources do you find yourself using as you complete this stage? (Make sure to include the links.)
* [HR Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaisalqureshi/hr-analytics-and-job-prediction?select=HR_comma_sep.csv)
* [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
* [scikit-learn Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
### Do you have any ethical considerations in this stage? 
* Handle private employee data with care
* Avoid biased modeling that could unfairly target certain groups or departments

## Analyze Phase

### * What did you observe about the relationships between variables?
### * What do you observe about the distributions in the data?
### * What transformations did you make with your data? Why did you chose to make those decisions?
### * What are some purposes of EDA before constructing a predictive model?
### * What resources do you find yourself using as you complete this stage? (Make sure to include the links.)
### * Do you have any ethical considerations in this stage?

## Construct Phase

### * Do you notice anything odd?
### * Which independent variables did you choose for the model and why?
### * Are each of the assumptions met?
### * How well does your model fit the data?
### * Can you improve it? Is there anything you would change about the model?
### * What resources do you find yourself using as you complete this stage? (Make sure to include the links.)
### * Do you have any ethical considerations in this stage?

## Execute Phase

### * What key insights emerged from your model(s)?
### * What business recommendations do you propose based on the models built?
### * What potential recommendations would you make to your manager/company?
### * Do you think your model could be improved? Why or why not? How?
### * Given what you know about the data and the models you were using, what other questions could you address for the team?
### * What resources do you find yourself using as you complete this stage? (Make sure to include the links.)
### * Do you have any ethical considerations in this stage?
